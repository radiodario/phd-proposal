# Research Proposal
Serialising Livecoding performances on an massively-online web platform.

## Introduction
Live coding is an art form. Be it a musical, or more recently, visual performance, these pieces entrhall and entertain audiences accross the world. The pieces themselves exist in their purest form only momentarily, while they are executed by the artist. As such, are usually are usually recorded as videos, effectively "freezing" them into a format that doesn't afford easy analysis.

Due to the relative infancy of live coding as an art form and the "raster" nature of the current preferred mode of storage, the study of these performances is practicaly limited to manual, ad-hoc work. However, code, the very medium used to create these pieces is inherently serialisable. While many artists divulge the results of these performances online as code, they lack a key aspect: a representation of the process undergone by the artist when creating the piece.

By recording the code and keystrokes inserted by the performers as they play, we enable these pieces to be stored and replayed in an interactive manner. This in turn would allow for analysis and evaluation, encouraging the creation of derivative works. Furthermore, the ability to formally study and analyse the process of these artists would enable more potential live coders to learn from more adept artists, as well as gaining insights on the nature of this novel artform.

We propose the creation of a platform that would combine the performance ability of environments such as SuperCollider or Livecodelab, but in an online manner, so that performances could be broadcast and enjoyed *live* without needing to be in the same physical space as the performer.

It is expected that this platform would also encourage collaboration between artists. Once the system is built, it would be trivial to create a multi-performer mode, so that more than one artist could have input at a given time. By making the system opensource, it is expected that the collaborative nature of the live coding scene would encourage other individuals to improve and create more modes - perhaps allowing for competitive "laptop battles" happening online for thousands to witness, enjoy and learn from.

## Research Questions
* Examining the effect of a freely accessible, online live coding performance platform would have on the nature of livecoding.
* How does the replayability and transparency of a live coding piece help lower the high entry barrier to live coding. Can an online platform help others learn how to livecode more effectively?
* Are there any common patterns on live coding performances that can be identified? Are there different *schools* or *styles* that can be quantitatively identifed? Could this online platform help create these styles?

## Process
Create an online platform for live coding, marrying currently existing browser-based live coding libraries with a framework that allows performer->audience interaction.
Provide a way for audiences to score and share the performances,
