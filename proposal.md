# Research Proposal
Serialising Livecoding performances on an massively-online web platform

## Introduction
Livecoding is an art form. Currently, livecoding performances are recorded as videos, effectively "freezing" the performance into a different format. However, the very nature of the medium (code) is inherently serialisable. This means that performances could be stored and replayed in an interactive manner, allowing for analysis, evaluation and the creation of derivative works.

We propose the creation of a platform that would combine the performance ability of environments such as SuperCollider or Livecodelab, but in an online manner, so that performances could be broadcasted and enjoyed *live* without needing to be in the same physical as the performer.

## Research Questions
1. Examining livecoding performances on a global scale. Build a platform that allows people to create livecoding performances, store and replay them. Establish correlations between popularity / score of a performance and expressivenes.
2. How does replayability and
